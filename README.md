# TDBUwithScale
The code for my PhD project: Scale-dependent predator-prey interaction in experiment and model systems.

Each directory has it's own README file.

## modeling
Code for modeling part of the project. Simulate a predator-herbivore model (as a ladybug-aphid system) to create time-series data like the empirical data.

## DataAnalysis
Data from the experiment, and code for compiling and visualizing data. 

## SharedAnalysis
The script to analyze data. since model and experimental data are to be analyzed in the same way, they share these files
