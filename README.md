# Ladybug aphid interaction with Scale
The code for my PhD project: Scale-dependent predator-prey interaction in experiment and model systems.

Running some functions require tools in [my Matlab utility]

Each directory has it's own README file.

## [fieldpattern]
Data and analysis of the field populations.

## [experiment]
Data from the experiment, and code for compiling and visualizing data. 

## [modeling]
Code for modeling part of the project. Simulate a predator-herbivore model (as a ladybug-aphid system) to create time-series data like the empirical data.

## [dataAnalysis]
The script to analyze data. since model and experimental data are to be analyzed in the same way, they share these files
