# DataAnalysis
This is the experimental/empirical part of my PhD project about predator-prey interaction.

## Data
* ./Data/DataLA.txt :Data for the insects count on each plant for each day in the experiment. Name of variables are stored in ColumnNames.txt
There are 13 columns, 2754 rows (observation data for 34 days x 81 plants)

* ./Data/ColumnNames.txt:   Name of variables (columns) for data stored in DataLA.txt

## Matlab scripts
* script_compile.m : the script that loads in data from ./Data/DataLA.txt and ./Data/ColumnNames.txt, and create data matrix for each taxa.
                     Outputs are 81 x 34 matrices.
